#  Youtube Dark Mode Chrome Extension
This project is the starter project that I created on my journey to learning how to create Chrome Extensions. It has basic functionality and UI.

##### What it can do
1. `It alerts a confirmation message when a page bookmark is made`
2. `It does a background check to insure the extension is installed successfully`
3. `It adds a button to all youtube channels (that are not in watch mode) that can turn the background color to black on click`


##### How to setup extension locally

1. Clone the repository
2. If you have the node module folder, then no need to install the dependencies, others install dependecies in the `package.json` file by the running the following command `npm install`
3. Open your chrome browser and navigate to `chrome:\\extensions`
4. Turn on developer mode
5. Select add extension and browse to the folder having extension files and upload that folder.
6. The extension will appear and you shall be able to use it by clicking the icon.

`NOTE:` Whenever you make changes, ensure you refresh the extension.
